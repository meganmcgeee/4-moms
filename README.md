Built with Bootstrap 4, jQuery, Slick Slider, Iconic Icons

### Why Bootstrap 4?

Bootstrap is the most popular mobile-first front end framework on the web so it seems like the right choice. Most mid-level front end developers have at least some exposure to it so in the event the project needed to be extended, there would be less time required to rewrite the code. It prioritizes rapid prototyping and manages all mobile-responsize aspects of development out-of-the box. It has a very low configuration time and is straightforward to customize. It is CSS preprocessor agnostic which adds flexibility and can accommodate different levels of familiarity with CSS preprocessors

### Why Slick Slider?

Slick Slider is extremely popular and fairly light in terms of size and performance cost.
